*"The past is history, the future's a mystery"*

*Stephen King*

Over the years I've developed a few unhealthy obsessions. As far as chemical substances go, that’s narrowed down to one: industrial quantities of coffee. The radiation coming off monitors falls into a separate category, I label as "questionable". Setting those aside, you don't have to look far to see that I also have an obsession with Stephen King. I am not sure where it all began but if I had to guess, it can probably be traced back to the "IT" mini series. It must have been the late 90's by the time the series reached my corner of the planet. One could argue that the series are a bit too much for a 10 year old kid but what could possibly go wrong, right? I can't express how much I wanted to get my hands on King's books. Luckily my parents were aware that his books were *a tiny bit* more graphic than the movie adaptations. But eventually I was old enough to start getting those books on my own. As far as IT is concerned, there is no denial that Mr. King went a bit overboard. Although arguably IT is his most successful novel, I found the rest of the Stephen King universe is absolutely mesmerizing. I can't say which one of his works is my favorite in any way. But The Dark Tower series is definitely up there but the reason might not entirely obvious. The one thing that mostly struck me in those was the introduction, which had nothing to do with the books themselves. The introduction was an essay titled "On being Nineteen (and a few other things)", which was written several decades after the books.

Every now and then I would re-read it and although it's only a few pages long, every time I see something different and find a new way to connect with it. For better or worse, I am not nineteen and haven't been for over a decade. Admittedly, at that age, like most people, I had very different life goals, which have absolutely nothing in common with how life turned out. At the time I had plenty of problems, which by my current standards were completely trivial to say the least. Nothing had prepared me for the events that took place in the next 12 months, let alone more than 10 years. Here Mr. King was right: at that age, you feel like the world belongs to you largely because you have the ability to get away with mistakes you make(most times anyway): you skip a lecture - big deal, you flunk a uni course - big whoop: there is always another day. A statement which turned out to be inherently false and a lesson I was forced to learn soon after.

As much as I had no meaningful or constructive way to deal with some of my surrounding issues at the time, my escape was calling a childhood friend and sharing my problems with him. Even though at first glance we were polar opposites, the only creature that is proving time and time again it's ready to happily be by my side through the 7 circles of hell with a smile on it's face is my dog(although in a more annoying in-your-face fashion). As for my friend, as kids we were inseparable. But as I already said, life didn't go as either of us had planned. At the time, I was living on the opposite end of the continent, all while he was not even on the same continent. And for the younger generation, this was kind of a big deal. We had to put serious thought and planning when it came to our communication(the "when", "where" and "how"'s). Sometimes Skype, which was a big thing at the time, but most times it was pay phones through some VoIP service as a middleware and occasionally over email when all other options failed. Which lead to one curious side effect: we were having several separate discussions on completely different and in most cases unrelated topics in parallel, yet we were able to keep track of them and it worked flawlessly. We had plans for the future: We hadn't settled on timelines or pinning actual targets but our goal was to eventually recreate our childhood environment: living across the street from one another, but this time somewhere in the US. And as he was living in the US, the first order of business was for him to settle down somewhere, while I save up enough money to make the hop across the pond. We couldn't find any obvious shortcuts so we were taking our time. I wanted to complete my studies first so we were well aware we had a few years to (hopefully) figure most things out and we had started building the foundations. Multiple and independent foundations as a matter of fact - there was no way we'd put all eggs in one basket. As a matter of fact, we had 6 separate plans on how to achieve our goal and as wild as it may seem, we were slowly taking the initial steps in all directions.

It was the sixth of April and I was just about to head to uni when Skype made it's usual annoying sound. I decided to take a peak since I had a few minutes to spare. It was another friend of ours who insisted that we need to have an urgent talk: In short, our friend had passed away in very questionable circumstances at his father’s office. Up until this point, I had no idea what having your life flipped around meant. I thought I did, but I couldn't have been further from the truth. King's "bad old Patrol Boy’s in the neighborhood, asking questions" was no longer only asking questions - everything became real. What truly happened to my friend became an X-file - no one knows exactly, some of us managed to connect some dots but we were never able to see the bigger picture and by the looks of it, we never will. But just as I re-read King's essay on occasions, I also log into my old email address(or his since I'm the only one who knew his password) and I re-read our conversations. It has been a long time and somehow the old problems look like faint silhouettes somewhere in the mist of the morning. Some are still very much around, others are completely lost in space and time. But one particular message really stands out from the crowd. The context is completely irrelevant, but one sentence he said hits me like a freight train every time: "fuck it, no matter what happens, we can count on each-other". As painful as it might be to read each time, I can't help myself and say something morbid you are likely to find in many of Stephen King's: *"Yeah... About that..."*

The one silhouette which is really standing out in the mist is my friend's. Even after all these years I can clearly remember his voice, his attitude and even his face, which is remarkable for someone who can't tell two people apart even if his life depends on it. I can't help but wonder what would our lives would have been, if he was still alive. We had our fair share of outlandish plans for the future and I wonder if we would have gone through with any of them or not. Where would we be and what would have either of us done differently. By implications, there's a good chance I would have been(roughly) where I am now for family reasons but the gap between then and now is(somewhat) substantial. And oddly enough, I would have loved to be able to seek his advice on many topics: As much as I disagreed with him on countless topics and I still do, I'm not afraid to admit when I'm wrong. There is at least in one area, I have to admit, he had the right idea.

As time passes by, I realize how hard I’ve changed my mindset and prospective: I am no longer willing to mindlessly taking huge risks and instead I’m trying to keep my head down and avoid making eye contact with King's policeman. Which is not to say that the phrase "how hard could that be" is probably the right answer in more situations than I’d like to admit. When you are 19, mistakes are often very cheap. But much like inflation, the prices and consequences keep rising over time for most people. I am not sure where that leaves me. Acceptance? Retribution? Closure? None of those, I'm afraid. Rage? Anger? Abundance...

After I moved back home, I was living in a tiny apartment not far from where we grew up. On the opposite end of the street to be more specific. That I believe was the last time I caught a cold. I could hardly get out of bed and for several days straight I was neither awake nor asleep. One night my phone rang - I did not have the strength to focus my eyes and see the number but I did manage to pick up. All of a sudden I heard a familiar voice: "I am OK, but I have to hide. I know you are doing alright. I am proud of you. Keep up the great work". The only thing I managed to say was "When will I get to see you"? After a moment of silence, I heard what I was already expecting to hear: "Probably never, it’s not safe". I can't remember the rest of the conversation. I woke up feeling better the next day but still incredibly confused. I was scared to look at my phone/ I went to take a shower then breakfast. Once I knew my body was fully functioning I found the courage to look at my phone. I pulled the call logs... Nothing... It was nothing but a dream. I will have such dreams once or twice a year. I know my friend is long gone and I'll never see him again. While it many not make a whole lot of sense, in a strange way those dreams bring me unfathomable amounts of happiness.
