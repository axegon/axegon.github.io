### The Fall of the (new) Roman Empire.

*"Thoughts are the shadows of our feelings - always darker, emptier and simpler."*

Regardless of how much I believe in capitalism, I feel like no one ever could have anticipated what social medias would turn out to be. The fact that very few people even remember there was a time before social medias existed is equally perplexing. I would have never thought that I'd see a 90 year old woman who can barely walk holding a tablet and scrolling through social media feeds. To be perfectly honest I never really saw the appeal in social medias. I spend 0 time on any social network not because I have an issue with the fact that all my data is collected on several hard drives in a datacenter somewhere - I'm well aware that whatever processing is done, it is fully automated with the sole purpose of shoving products down my throat and not because an evil mastermind wants to go over my internet history. In all honesty I'd be flattered if someone showed that much interest in me. I know no one looks into the data because I myself worked at a company that collected petabytes of data about it's users and I actively participated in the development process - no one really cares or bothers to look into any of that. Some people find it hard to admit but no one is so profoundly unique that would cause someone else to start looking them up. But the truth is, I never really saw the point in social media to begin with: I never wanted to share my experiences, achievements or personal moments with anyone, in the same way I never really understood selfies: to me a picture should capture the world through my eyes, not through someone else's. But much beyond the philosophical aspect of it all, social medias created something which I'm certain no one really expected.

Funny enough, many people had recommended me Yuval Noah Harari's "Homo Deus" and I got the book about a week before the first news about COVID hit. And when it did, I was optimistic because of the first chapter of the book, largely dedicated to the crisis around the Spanish flu in the early 20-th century: It wouldn't be the first time humanity faces such crisis and as bad as it may have been, it's managed to beat the odds. Almost two years later my optimism has completely disappeared. I'm not optimistic about things going back to the way they were prior to 2020(on unrelated note I don't really miss those times at all). And to be perfectly honest, I feel like social medias are to be blamed largely for it. Back in the first half of the 2000's, more often than not, you'd see someone standing on top of a wooden crate in the middle of a city square, shouting something about some conspiracy. It's easy to dismiss a man who hasn't had a shower in over a month and smells of trash, alcohol and cigarettes while behaving like someone who just escaped from a mental institution. But it appeared that those were an insignificant minority. The only other notable example I can think of is back when I was 6 or 7 and my mom had signed me up for piano lessons. However the piano we had at home sounded like it was dropped off a building and we called a professional to come and fix it up. And he did. But while he was doing it, he decided to share his life story. I reckon he was in his late 20's to early 30's. The man was convinced that there was a government plot against him, so he was sneaking out of his home at night, going to a pay phone, calling his house and in his words, someone pretending to be him was answering the phone. He had gone as far as to write a book and photocopy the entire thing in order to distribute it freely. Even my dumb 6 year old mind was able to tell that something wasn't right in his head. He looked fine but as soon as he started talking, you could immediately tell something is off. I have no idea where he is or if he's even alive two decades later. But here's the thing: in real life, you'd probably ignore someone like that when you see them in person, brush them off as insane and try to cut your interaction short. But ["On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog). A long time ago in an IRC channel someone typed "let's get this straight, am I the only one who thinks this is wrong:". And before they managed to type the next sentence, someone replied "no, this is the internet, you are never the only one, get over it". Social media allowed the man on the wooden crate and the guy fixing pianos to team up and form a club, where no one can question their beliefs, authority or authenticity, all while being able to hide the critical details which would make most people roll their eyes and walk away. If anything, whoever starts questioning their views is immediately discredited by being accused of being a government spy, a paid troll or a fascist(or all those combined to add more spices to the mix). While internet communities grow and shrink overtime, the one formed by our two protagonists can only grow - over there, no one is an outcast, so long as they are willing to accept some, at first glance, minor compromises. But after some time people get dragged more and more into them. I am not sure if this is a form of Stockholm syndrome or something else but those groups offer everything people were not offered in real life - someone to roll with them and clap at every word they say - validation and approval: anyone can be an economist, civil engineer, cryptographer, virologist, hematologist or anything else you could think of.

Make no mistake - this isn't a direct consequence of social medias, they are just a platforms that offer safe haven for those individuals. There is no conspiracy here for better or worse. Two things that will sell absolutely anything immediately: fear and hope. Social medias offers communities that are giving both of those away for free. Perhaps a bit morbid but sooner or later you will end up looking at the corpse of someone who decided to run across the motorway instead of using the underpass and think to yourself: "If only there was a simple way this tragedy could have been avoided".
